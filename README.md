# Player Shield Mod
> Version 1.2a

Player Shield Mod is a server-side addon for GMod providing anti-griefing features.

**Features:**

- 60-second Spawn kill protection
- "Peace" mode

**Dependencies:**

- Ulysses Mod

**"Peace" Mode:**

Peace mode may be activated by sending `!shield` or `!neutral` in chat. While activated, one is unable to be killed. If, however, they kill another player their shield will be removed and other players can kill them again with a 45 minute re-activation cooldown.

**Anti-Spawn Kill:**

The spawn kill protection works similar to the "peace" mode, but rather than when they kill a player it is stripped when they harm a player.

**To-do:**
- Make cooldown time modifiable
- Make peace mode disableable.
